# Mississippi-Tweet-Analysis
This is a personal project that I just started, examining tweets from politicians in Mississippi and looking for patterns

I am fascinated by Natural Language Processing, but it seems as though I find myself holed up in problems related to 
numeric classification or regression problems too often. To combat this predictability, I started diving into web scraping using 
the twitter API. After registering an app, it is amazing how much data you can scrape! I wanted to start a project looking into 
how the politicians (both Democrat and Republican) are expressing their thoughts on twitter, and what the major themes seemed 
to be when these tweets were analyzed. My working hypothesis to begin this project was that they don't like each other, I admit this
was a rather safe alternative hypothesis, but really, I am simply going on an exploratory mission here, trying to figure out what
patterns emerge from this text analysis. Thus far, I have looked into the governors tweets to start things off, so that is what 
this notebook covers thus far. I will be updating this project accordingly, when I can take time away from school to do so. If 
anyone has any questions, please shoot me an emal at fultoncannon@gmail.com
